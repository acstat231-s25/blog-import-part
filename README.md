# Raw Data
Hello! To access the raw data, please follow the following instructions:
1. Sign into [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com)
2. Go to the [Steam Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset)
3. Press the "Download" button, and save the dataset as zip.
4. Unzip the data. You should have two files: "games.csv" and "games.json"
5. Move "games.csv" and "games.json" into the "data" folder and then the "raw" folder.

You now have access to the data used in "wrangle_game.qmd" within the "scripts" folder, which produced the dataset used in each analysis.
