There were also a several words that were on the top 10 across different years, which are: “enemies”, “battle”, and “adventure”. In most years, more than half the terms evoke a negative sentiment whereas in 2015, there was a balanced mixture of both positive and negative AFINN words."

This poses a few questions: What textual commonalites do they both share that may contribute to their high ratings? What does that say about STEAM’s audience?\n\nElder Scrolls IV Deluxe Word CloudElder Scrolls IV Deluxe Sentiment Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHover to see the word associated with the value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Word CloudGrand Theft Auto V Sentiment Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHover to see the word associated with the value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s interesting to see that while both games differ in terms of settings and their overall themes, they share several terms, one especially is “world”. Other terms such as “characters” and “explore” hint their similarity as games that empower players to roam in their respective realms and engage in roleplaying. Perhaps this similarity also contribute to their statuses as top rated games, as these games that enable high immersive interaction and exploration may appeal to most of STEAM’s audience. While there are many similarities, a noticeable difference between the two games lies in their average sentimental values. Elder Scrolls IV has a balanced mixture of both positive and negative words while Grand Theft Auto V has more positive words."

Tags are user suggested words or short phrases that describe each game. The color and width of each edge is determined by the number of shared tags.\nThe other variable displayed on the network is a boolean node variable which records if a game’s steam reviews are overwhelmingly positive. On Steam a user can rate a game with either a thumbs up or down, if 95% or more of the reviews are a thumbs up the game marked as having overwhelming positive reviews. The data set gives the number of positive user reviews and negative user reviews, I divided positive reviews by the sum of positive user reviews and negative user reviews to get the percentage. The node is colored red if the percentage is below 95% but blue if it is.\n\n\nThis image shows the steam page of my favorite game and one visualized in some of these networks, Portal 2.

One thing I noticed was action games in famous high budget series like Grand Theft Auto and The Elder Scrolls had higher degree centrality while games in other genres like the Portal 2 and Persona 5 had much lower degree centrality. This shows the tendency of these large budget action games to get high Metacritic scores. The average weighted degree is 1093.8 which is higher then many any of the cluster’s average weighted degree, this shows that the top rated games on Metacritic are similar in their own ways."

The game Konung 2 has the lowest weighted degree in this network and is tied for the lowest degree on any network.

The games in this network are over represented in the top 10 games showing that this type of game (one that has high age requirements, price, and recommendations) is predisposed to succeed critically.

Each word can be assigned to a value from -5 to +5, with negative values indicative of negative sentiments and positive values indicative of positive sentiments. For instance, words such as “happy”, “adventurous”, and “magic” would have positive values, while words like “disgust’ and”evil” would have negative values.\n\n\nStop Words:\nStop words are essentially your everyday words that don’t really contribute to meanings or ideas. They include articles such as “the” and “is”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Visualizations exclude most games which descriptions are in other languages."

    "text": "Take-Aways\nA recurring theme found in most words is action. Whether it be analyzing game descriptions from big, small, or chronological scale, I tend to see most words related to action. Additionally, prevalent words that have a negative AFINN values are typically about challenges such as combat or war while those with positive AFINN values are typically descriptive- “fun”, “glory”, “powerful”, etc. What piqued my curiosity was the fact that prevalent words remain similar across time, and there were several that even stayed in the top 10. Perhaps this is due to the fact that action games tend to be more popular, as reinforced by my partners’ analyses. Action games entice players with prospects of fun challenges and immersive exploration. Hence, more games that are released are in the genre of action than others genres. Overall, textual analysis can be used to reveal trends and insights such as those uncovered in this project, which can contribute to market research in the field of entertainment such as video-games production."
