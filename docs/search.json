This poses a few questions: What textual commonalites do they both share that may contribute to their high ratings? What does that say about STEAM’s audience?\n\nElder Scrolls IV Deluxe Word CloudElder Scrolls IV Deluxe Sentiment Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHover to see the word associated with the value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V Word CloudGrand Theft Auto V Sentiment Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHover to see the word associated with the value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s interesting to see that while both games differ in terms of settings and their overall themes, they share several terms, one especially is world. Other terms such as characters and explore hint their similarity as games that empower players to roam in their respective realms and engage in roleplaying. Perhaps this similarity also contribute to their statuses as top rated games, as these games that enable high immersive interaction and exploration may appeal to most of STEAM’s audience."
