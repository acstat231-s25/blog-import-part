Tens of thousands of games are currently on the platform, which all cater towards various users. Steam collects information about each video game, such as name, price, rating, and game description. This data was parsed into the Kaggle Steam Games Dataset (Roman 2022), which we used to begin our guided analysis of the many games on the high-esteemed platform. Some questions we have are:\n\nWhat trends can we uncover through clustering games based on their characteristics? What can these insights tell us?\nWhat are some prominent patterns within game descriptions? Are games generally positive or negative based on how they are described?\nHow are popular games connected to each other? What characteristics do they share?\n\n\n\nData\nWe got our data from Kaggle, a website that serves as a collection of datasets for data scientists and machine learning engineers. The Steam Games Dataset (Roman 2022) utilizes Steam API and Steam Spy to scrape data from thousands of Steam games.The data came in .csv and .json files. After examination of the .csv file, the data were shifted and, unfortunately, unusable. Therefore, we further wrangled the .json file (Carpentries 2025) to obtain game data for this project.\nWe transposed (Wickham and Henry 2023) the data to get appropriate game data as row entries, and parsed quantitative values as numeric variables. We also removed games with incomplete or duplicate game information and titles in Korean, Chinese, and Japanese.\n\n\nAnalyses\nWith this dataset limited to games in English, we were then able to:\n\nFind similarities between different games through clustering\nAnalyze patterns and trends in game descriptions\nExplore how games are connected to one another\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCarpentries, T.

You may also have other images or figures saved for displaying in your blog that will also need to be organized. Here are recommendations for organization.\n\nscripts: Store wrangling scripts in their own folder\ndata: Store datasets in their own folder, being sure to separate raw data from clean/processed data. You can do this in one of two ways: two separate data folders in the root directory (e.g., raw-data and data) or two subfolders of a single data folder (subfolders called, for example, raw, processed).\nimages: Organize saved images or figures together in their own folder. Make sure you keep track of the source of the images or figures and credit the sources in some way in your page (include source in caption and/or link image to source)"

You should use standard bibtex syntax for each entry, following the examples provided. If the resource you are using doesn’t already provide a way to generate a bibtex entry, I recommend using zoterobib to generate the appropriate syntax (must change the Bibliography style to “BibTeX generic citation style”). The entries currently in library.bib are intended to provide syntax examples that capture the range of entries you are most likely to use. You will need to delete and replace the contents of library.bib with your own citation entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe examples in library.bib are nicely formatted so you can read and follow the patterns, but formatting and order of the library.bib file doesn’t actually matter and will not be assessed.

    "title": "Grouping Games Through Clustering",
    "section": "",
    "text": "To address the question about which video games are similar (and how), I wanted to use unsupervised learning techniques. I will use k-means clustering as a way to assign video games to distinct groups, which may uncover similarities between the games.\n\n\nFor this analysis, I chose 9 quantitative variables to cluster the games by as follows:\n\nrequired_age - The age required to to buy and play the game.\nprice - The price of the game.\ndlc_count - The count of how much Downloadable Content (DLC) the game has. This is additional game content that can be purchased.\nmetacritic_score - The score given by Metacritic, a platform that rates games, movies, TV shows, and albums. This is a numeric score out of 100 based off of the weighted average of highly respected critics’ reviews.\nachievements - The number of achievements in the game.\nrecommendations - The number of recommendations that the game received.\nmedian_playtime_forever - The median playtime in minutes since the game’s release.\npeak_ccu - The highest number of concurrent users (CCU) of the game in a given period.\nplayer_rating_ratio - A self-created statistic that describes how players think of the game by dividing the net positive review count (positive - negative) by total number of reviews. The value ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 means that all reviews were negative (hated), 0 means that there were an equal number of positive and negative reviews (neutral), and 1 means that all reviews were positive (loved).\n\nSince the variables on different scales (e.g. 0 to 100, -1 to 1, and 0 to 1,000,000+), it is important to standardize the variables (i.e. level the playing field). This way, the locations of the centroids will not be dominated by its relation to one variable over another when using k-means clustering.\n\n\n\nSince we are working with 9 quantitative variables, to determine the optimal number of clusters, I first consulted an elbow plot. We want to look at when the within-cluster variance is relatively small, without creating too many clusters. However, with too many clusters, it may become too difficult to interpret the results or for the results to hold any significant meaning. Therefore, based on the elbow plot (see Figure 1), 5 clusters appear to be reasonably optimal as it is where the graph “bends” without containing too many clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Elbow Plot Indicates A Bend at 5 Clusters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter performing a k-means clustering with k = 5 clusters, it appears that our clusters are grouped by the following characteristics (see Table 1):\n\nCluster 1: Higher DLC counts, extremely high number of achievements, and lower player ratings.\nCluster 2: Generally average values across the variables except for lower Metacritic scores and high player ratings.\nCluster 3: Highest age requirements, highest prices, higher Metacritic scores, high number of recommendations, and the highest CCU counts.\nCluster 4: Lowest median playtimes and lowest player ratings.\nCluster 5: Higher prices, highest DLC counts, highest Metacritic scores, higher number of recommendations, and highest median playtimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Each Quantitative Variable is Standardized\n\n\nCluster\nRequired Age\nPrice ($)\nDLC Count\nMetacritic Score\nAchievements\nRecommendations\nMedian Playtime Forever (min)\nPeak CCU\nPlayer Rating Ratio\n\n\n\n\n1\n-0.141\n-0.357\n0.201\n-0.239\n23.643\n-0.037\n-0.009\n-0.025\n-0.414\n\n\n2\n-0.140\n-0.012\n-0.014\n-0.239\n-0.036\n-0.038\n-0.018\n-0.014\n0.478\n\n\n3\n6.931\n0.922\n0.129\n1.387\n0.026\n1.195\n0.163\n0.677\n-0.087\n\n\n4\n-0.140\n-0.221\n-0.019\n-0.235\n-0.062\n-0.058\n-0.043\n-0.024\n-1.486\n\n\n5\n-0.141\n0.845\n0.238\n4.017\n0.044\n0.341\n0.404\n0.039\n0.151\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Locations of Centroids based on Standardized Variables\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Cluster 1 contains games that may cater towards completionists, although lacking in positive ratings. Cluster 2 contains “average” games that are not approved by Metacritics but are loved by players. Cluster 3 contains expensive games that are catered towards older audiences and are widely recommended and played. Cluster 4 contains games that are subjectively terrible; players do not play these games for long and give bad ratings. Finally, Cluster 5 contains expensive games with a lot of content for committed players; these games are widely shared and receive high Metacritic scores.\nLet’s see how well the clustering grouped the games! To do so, I will take a random sample (Wickham et al. 2023) of games within each cluster.\n\nCluster 1Cluster 2Cluster 3Cluster 4Cluster 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nCluster\nRelease Date\nRequired Age\nPrice ($)\nDLC Count\nMetacritic Score\nAchievements\nRecommendations\nMedian Playtime Forever (min)\nPeak CCU\nPlayer Rating Ratio\n\n\n\n\nAchievement Idler: Black\n1\nApr 13, 2018\n0\n0.99\n0\n0\n5000\n278\n0\n1\n0.681\n\n\nHUBE: Seeker of Achievements\n1\nMay 16, 2018\n0\n0.99\n0\n0\n4805\n0\n17\n0\n0.370\n\n\nTrivia Vault: Video Game Trivia Deluxe\n1\nOct 24, 2017\n0\n14.99\n0\n0\n5000\n0\n0\n0\n0.013\n\n\nProfessor Watts Memory Match: Shapes And Colors\n1\nJul 27, 2017\n0\n4.99\n0\n0\n5000\n0\n0\n0\n0.042\n\n\nTrivia Vault: Classic Rock Trivia 2\n1\nAug 23, 2017\n0\n9.99\n0\n0\n5000\n0\n0\n0\n0.081\n\n\nAZURA\n1\nNov 13, 2017\n0\n1.99\n0\n0\n4732\n208\n0\n0\n0.270\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Table Featuring Games From Cluster 1\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 2, we can see that Achievement Idler: Black, HUBE: Seeker of Achievements, and Trivia Vault: Video Game Trivia Deluxe are similar as they have high achievement counts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nCluster\nRelease Date\nRequired Age\nPrice ($)\nDLC Count\nMetacritic Score\nAchievements\nRecommendations\nMedian Playtime Forever (min)\nPeak CCU\nPlayer Rating Ratio\n\n\n\n\nSmart Game Booster\n2\nMay 11, 2020\n0\n0.00\n1\n0\n0\n0\n998\n611\n0.487\n\n\nFINAL FANTASY IV\n2\nSep 8, 2021\n0\n17.99\n0\n0\n30\n1263\n885\n70\n0.767\n\n\nCowgirl Adventures\n2\nJul 29, 2022\n0\n1.39\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.333\n\n\nSunset Humanity\n2\nOct 22, 2024\n0\n3.99\n0\n0\n5\n0\n0\n0\n1.000\n\n\nAll Fall Down\n2\nOct 16, 2015\n0\n0.99\n0\n0\n8\n0\n296\n0\n0.333\n\n\nThe fairy tale you don't know\n2\nJan 22, 2021\n0\n18.99\n0\n0\n0\n138\n0\n1\n0.592\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Table Featuring Games From Cluster 2\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 3, we can see that Smart Game Booster, FINAL FANTASY IV, and Cowgirl Adventures are similar as they have low Metacritic scores of 0 and positive player ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nCluster\nRelease Date\nRequired Age\nPrice ($)\nDLC Count\nMetacritic Score\nAchievements\nRecommendations\nMedian Playtime Forever (min)\nPeak CCU\nPlayer Rating Ratio\n\n\n\n\nThe Jungle\n3\nSep 1, 2020\n16\n19.99\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n-0.556\n\n\nMeet Your Maker\n3\nApr 4, 2023\n17\n29.99\n1\n0\n43\n1362\n493\n2715\n0.651\n\n\nHacker.exe\n3\nSep 14, 2018\n13\n8.99\n0\n0\n12\n0\n0\n0\n-0.478\n\n\nPhantasmal: Survival Horror Roguelike\n3\nApr 14, 2016\n13\n0.00\n0\n0\n55\n124\n1\n1\n-0.091\n\n\nDRAGON QUEST HEROES™ Slime Edition\n3\nDec 3, 2015\n13\n39.99\n0\n0\n50\n1074\n225\n5\n0.355\n\n\nPsihanul\n3\nNov 7, 2019\n16\n2.99\n0\n0\n9\n0\n0\n0\n-1.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Table Featuring Games From Cluster 3\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 4, we can see that The Jungle, Meet Your Maker, and Hacker.exe are similar as they have high required ages (13+) and are not free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nCluster\nRelease Date\nRequired Age\nPrice ($)\nDLC Count\nMetacritic Score\nAchievements\nRecommendations\nMedian Playtime Forever (min)\nPeak CCU\nPlayer Rating Ratio\n\n\n\n\nKING HAJWALA\n4\nJul 29, 2021\n0\n6.99\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.200\n\n\nStakeholder Game\n4\nFeb 10, 2022\n0\n9.99\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n-0.455\n\n\nRitter\n4\nAug 12, 2018\n0\n0.99\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n-0.500\n\n\nGevaudan\n4\nJun 8, 2017\n0\n2.99\n0\n0\n0\n0\n8\n0\n0.231\n\n\nK.O.M.A\n4\nMar 14, 2019\n0\n1.99\n0\n0\n8\n0\n0\n0\n0.200\n\n\nWondership Q\n4\nJul 18, 2016\n0\n9.99\n0\n0\n11\n0\n0\n0\n-0.143\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Table Featuring Games From Cluster 4\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 5, we can see that KING HAJWALA, Stakeholder Game, and Ritter are similar as they have low median playtimes (0 minutes!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nCluster\nRelease Date\nRequired Age\nPrice ($)\nDLC Count\nMetacritic Score\nAchievements\nRecommendations\nMedian Playtime Forever (min)\nPeak CCU\nPlayer Rating Ratio\n\n\n\n\nGuild Wars: Eye of the North®\n5\nOct 8, 2010\n0\n19.99\n0\n79\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1.000\n\n\nPrimal Carnage\n5\nOct 29, 2012\n0\n4.99\n9\n67\n69\n4828\n238\n6\n0.536\n\n\nCitizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector\n5\nJan 31, 2025\n0\n22.49\n2\n86\n30\n602\n0\n404\n0.867\n\n\nTrue Love\n5\nJun 27, 2024\n0\n500.00\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1.000\n\n\nArmada 2526 Gold Edition\n5\nFeb 28, 2013\n0\n3.59\n0\n66\n0\n0\n616\n2\n0.299\n\n\nCurse: The Eye of Isis\n5\nAug 22, 2014\n0\n0.59\n0\n63\n0\n108\n32\n0\n0.468\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Table Featuring Games From Cluster 5\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 6, we can see that Guild Wars: Eye of the North®, Primal Carnage, and Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector are similar as they have higher Metacritic Scores and are not free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Tables 2-6, we can see that even games within the same cluster are not completely alike. This is logical because the elbow plot (see Figure 1) showcased a lot of within-cluster variability for 5 clusters. One way to decrease the variability is to find more variables that could address this question of “which games are similar?”. On the other hand, perhaps one of the 9 variables used in this analysis was negatively impacting the within-cluster variability. In future analyses, I will look deeper into the quantitative variables by examining their distributions to check for discrepancies in the data.\nAlthough clustering did not perfectly group games from the 9 quantitative variables, we could still see some similarities based on game price, required age, and player reviews! Games target different players, so this analysis succeeded in some way."

    "text": "For this component I have displayed the network of the top 10 highest rated games on Metacritic in general and in each cluster from the cluster analysis. Metacritic is a platform that averages critic score for video games, it is a lot like Rotten Tomatoes. I used a few variables to create the network;\n\nFor the edges the variable I used were tags, specifically the number of shared tags between each game. Tags are user suggested words or short phrases that describe each game. The color and width of each edge is determined by the number of shared tags.\nThe other variable displayed on the network is a boolean node variable which records if a game’s steam reviews are overwhelmingly positive. On Steam a user can rate a game with either a thumbs up or down, if 95% or more of the reviews are a thumbs up the game marked as having overwhelming positive reviews. The data set gives the number of positive user reviews and negative user reviews, I divided positive reviews by the sum of positive user reviews and negative user reviews to get the percentage. The node is colored red if the percentage is below 95% but blue if it is.\n\nDisclaimer: Analysis for each graph shows up when you click on the corresponding tab, cluster one is not shown due to inappropriate results\n\nGeneral Top 10 NetworkCluster 2Cluster 3Cluster 4Cluster 5\n\n\n\nThe network shows a few interesting things about the top Metacritic rated games. Metacritic is a platform that averages critic score for video games, it is a lot like Rotten Tomatoes. The edges demonstrate a connection between two games via shared tags. The more shared tags, the bluer the color of the edge is and the thicker it is. Games with a higher weighted degree shared more connections, which were weighted by the number of tags for each edge. One thing I noticed were action games in famous high budget series like GTA, Red Dead Redemption and the Elder Scrolls had higher degree centrality while games in other genres like the Baseball game and Microsoft Flight simulator had much lower degree centrality. This shows the tendency of these large budget action games to get high Metacritic scores.\n\n\n\nThus network has a much lower range of weighted degree then the network for the top 10 games, as many of these games seem to not share many tags. Only one of these games is overwhelmingly positive on steam - Boolons TD5, this game also has a noteably higher degree centrality than the rest of them.\n\n\n\nThis network has a higher range of weighted degree then any other cluster, and many of these games are overwhelmingly positive"

This is additional game content that can be purchased.\nmetacritic_score - The score given by Metacritic, a platform that rates games, movies, TV shows, and albums. This is a numeric score out of 100 based off of the weighted average of highly respected critics’ reviews.\nachievements - The number of achievements in the game.\nrecommendations - The number of recommendations that the game received.\nmedian_playtime_forever - The median playtime in minutes since the game’s release.\npeak_ccu - The highest number of concurrent users (CCU) of the game in a given period.\nplayer_rating_ratio - A self-created statistic that describes how players think of the game by dividing the net positive review count (positive - negative) by total number of reviews. The value ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 means that all reviews were negative (hated), 0 means that there were an equal number of positive and negative reviews (neutral), and 1 means that all reviews were positive (loved).\n\nSince the variables on different scales (e.g. 0 to 100, -1 to 1, and 0 to 1,000,000+), it is important to standardize the variables (i.e. level the playing field). This way, the locations of the centroids will not be dominated by its relation to one variable over another when using k-means clustering."

To do so, I will take a random sample (Wickham et al. 2023) of games within each cluster.\n\nCluster 1Cluster 2Cluster 3Cluster 4Cluster 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nCluster\nRelease Date\nRequired Age\nPrice ($)\nDLC Count\nMetacritic Score\nAchievements\nRecommendations\nMedian Playtime Forever (min)\nPeak CCU\nPlayer Rating Ratio\n\n\n\n\nAchievement Idler: Black\n1\nApr 13, 2018\n0\n0.99\n0\n0\n5000\n278\n0\n1\n0.681\n\n\nHUBE: Seeker of Achievements\n1\nMay 16, 2018\n0\n0.99\n0\n0\n4805\n0\n17\n0\n0.370\n\n\nTrivia Vault: Video Game Trivia Deluxe\n1\nOct 24, 2017\n0\n14.99\n0\n0\n5000\n0\n0\n0\n0.013\n\n\nProfessor Watts Memory Match: Shapes And Colors\n1\nJul 27, 2017\n0\n4.99\n0\n0\n5000\n0\n0\n0\n0.042\n\n\nTrivia Vault: Classic Rock Trivia 2\n1\nAug 23, 2017\n0\n9.99\n0\n0\n5000\n0\n0\n0\n0.081\n\n\nAZURA\n1\nNov 13, 2017\n0\n1.99\n0\n0\n4732\n208\n0\n0\n0.270\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Table Featuring Games From Cluster 1\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 2, we can see that Achievement Idler: Black, HUBE: Seeker of Achievements, and Trivia Vault: Video Game Trivia Deluxe are similar as they have high achievement counts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nCluster\nRelease Date\nRequired Age\nPrice ($)\nDLC Count\nMetacritic Score\nAchievements\nRecommendations\nMedian Playtime Forever (min)\nPeak CCU\nPlayer Rating Ratio\n\n\n\n\nSmart Game Booster\n2\nMay 11, 2020\n0\n0.00\n1\n0\n0\n0\n998\n611\n0.487\n\n\nFINAL FANTASY IV\n2\nSep 8, 2021\n0\n17.99\n0\n0\n30\n1263\n885\n70\n0.767\n\n\nCowgirl Adventures\n2\nJul 29, 2022\n0\n1.39\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.333\n\n\nSunset Humanity\n2\nOct 22, 2024\n0\n3.99\n0\n0\n5\n0\n0\n0\n1.000\n\n\nAll Fall Down\n2\nOct 16, 2015\n0\n0.99\n0\n0\n8\n0\n296\n0\n0.333\n\n\nThe fairy tale you don't know\n2\nJan 22, 2021\n0\n18.99\n0\n0\n0\n138\n0\n1\n0.592\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Table Featuring Games From Cluster 2\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 3, we can see that Smart Game Booster, FINAL FANTASY IV, and Cowgirl Adventures are similar as they have low Metacritic scores of 0 and positive player ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nCluster\nRelease Date\nRequired Age\nPrice ($)\nDLC Count\nMetacritic Score\nAchievements\nRecommendations\nMedian Playtime Forever (min)\nPeak CCU\nPlayer Rating Ratio\n\n\n\n\nThe Jungle\n3\nSep 1, 2020\n16\n19.99\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n-0.556\n\n\nMeet Your Maker\n3\nApr 4, 2023\n17\n29.99\n1\n0\n43\n1362\n493\n2715\n0.651\n\n\nHacker.exe\n3\nSep 14, 2018\n13\n8.99\n0\n0\n12\n0\n0\n0\n-0.478\n\n\nPhantasmal: Survival Horror Roguelike\n3\nApr 14, 2016\n13\n0.00\n0\n0\n55\n124\n1\n1\n-0.091\n\n\nDRAGON QUEST HEROES™ Slime Edition\n3\nDec 3, 2015\n13\n39.99\n0\n0\n50\n1074\n225\n5\n0.355\n\n\nPsihanul\n3\nNov 7, 2019\n16\n2.99\n0\n0\n9\n0\n0\n0\n-1.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Table Featuring Games From Cluster 3\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 4, we can see that The Jungle, Meet Your Maker, and Hacker.exe are similar as they have high required ages (13+) and are not free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nCluster\nRelease Date\nRequired Age\nPrice ($)\nDLC Count\nMetacritic Score\nAchievements\nRecommendations\nMedian Playtime Forever (min)\nPeak CCU\nPlayer Rating Ratio\n\n\n\n\nKING HAJWALA\n4\nJul 29, 2021\n0\n6.99\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.200\n\n\nStakeholder Game\n4\nFeb 10, 2022\n0\n9.99\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n-0.455\n\n\nRitter\n4\nAug 12, 2018\n0\n0.99\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n-0.500\n\n\nGevaudan\n4\nJun 8, 2017\n0\n2.99\n0\n0\n0\n0\n8\n0\n0.231\n\n\nK.O.M.A\n4\nMar 14, 2019\n0\n1.99\n0\n0\n8\n0\n0\n0\n0.200\n\n\nWondership Q\n4\nJul 18, 2016\n0\n9.99\n0\n0\n11\n0\n0\n0\n-0.143\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Table Featuring Games From Cluster 4\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 5, we can see that KING HAJWALA, Stakeholder Game, and Ritter are similar as they have low median playtimes (0 minutes!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nCluster\nRelease Date\nRequired Age\nPrice ($)\nDLC Count\nMetacritic Score\nAchievements\nRecommendations\nMedian Playtime Forever (min)\nPeak CCU\nPlayer Rating Ratio\n\n\n\n\nGuild Wars: Eye of the North®\n5\nOct 8, 2010\n0\n19.99\n0\n79\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1.000\n\n\nPrimal Carnage\n5\nOct 29, 2012\n0\n4.99\n9\n67\n69\n4828\n238\n6\n0.536\n\n\nCitizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector\n5\nJan 31, 2025\n0\n22.49\n2\n86\n30\n602\n0\n404\n0.867\n\n\nTrue Love\n5\nJun 27, 2024\n0\n500.00\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1.000\n\n\nArmada 2526 Gold Edition\n5\nFeb 28, 2013\n0\n3.59\n0\n66\n0\n0\n616\n2\n0.299\n\n\nCurse: The Eye of Isis\n5\nAug 22, 2014\n0\n0.59\n0\n63\n0\n108\n32\n0\n0.468\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Table Featuring Games From Cluster 5\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 6, we can see that Guild Wars: Eye of the North®, Primal Carnage, and Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector are similar as they have higher Metacritic Scores and are not free."

    "text": "From Tables 2-6, we can see that even games within the same cluster are not completely alike. This is logical because the elbow plot (see Figure 1) showcased a lot of within-cluster variability for 5 clusters. One way to decrease the variability is to find more variables that could address this question of “which games are similar?”. On the other hand, perhaps one of the 9 variables used in this analysis was negatively impacting the within-cluster variability. In future analyses, I will look deeper into the quantitative variables by examining their distributions to check for discrepancies in the data.\nAlthough clustering did not perfectly group games from the 9 quantitative variables, we could still see some similarities based on game price, required age, and player reviews! Games target different players, so this analysis succeeded in some way."
